### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am peepopoggers.

I specialize in developing applications using node, and I base lots of my work around crypto.

Every repository I own is licensed under AGPL3.0 unless stated otherwise.

Ever since GitHub added profile READMEs they've been overused, push important content down, and get kinda monotonous.
With that said here's a cool animated thing that shows stats.
