### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am peepopoggers.

I specialize in developing open source applications, and I base some of my work around cryptocurrencies, as they can provide personal monetary freedom.
I am also in favor of alternate technology, privacy and security, and I am interested in contributing where possible to such projects.

I also made my account name on a whim.

### termcrypt

[termcrypt](https://github.com/termcrypt) is an interface to interact with the markets in a dynamic and efficient way. No longer do you have to be looking at a user interface that makes trading interfaces like gambling, but you can instead use an interface that does not promote overleveraging and instead promotes consistent trading.

I believe most modern exchanges design their interfaces to make people lose money and it is understandable why. They do not provide risk calculation inside of their interfaces and they impliment flashy UI, emphasis on wins and more. The reason termcrypt exists is to address this problem. Without an application to automatically calculate risk size, you could lose an entry while calculating with all of the parameters needed.
